public class Composition {

    /*
    having a instance of another class as
    a field variable instead of extending

        Inheritance : IS-A relationship between the classes
        Composition: HAS-A relationship

        FAVOUR COMPOSITION OVER INHERITANCE !!
            Easier to build structures out of components so with
            composition -> rather than trying to find the
            commonality between them + construct a family tree
